# Gas Leakage Detection Prototype
## Project Overview

This project is a gas leakage detection system designed to enhance safety in residential, industrial, and commercial environments. It uses an MQ-8 gas sensor to detect hazardous gases and triggers an LED alert when a leakage is detected. The system is built using an 8085 Microprocessor Kit and 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface to process sensor data and provide real-time warnings.

## Components Used
-8085 Microprocessor Kit
-8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface
-ADC-0809 (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
-MQ-8 Gas Sensor
-LED (Leakage Indicator)

## Circuit and Interfacing
The system is designed with proper interfacing between the 8085 microprocessor, 8255 PPI, and ADC-0809 to ensure accurate data acquisition and processing is given in the PDF file.

## Assembly Code (8085)
Given in the PDF file.
